    <h3>‚ÄúOur Stories, Our Mission‚Äù</h3>
    <p>Interactive video series celebrating Alma College‚Äôs heritage</p>
    <p><strong>‚ÄúOur Stories, Our Mission‚Äù</strong> is an interactive collection of alumni and campus leader interviews, featured on a touchscreen display in the Greg Hatcher Learning Commons and shared on YouTube and social media.</p>
    <p>In 2024‚Äì25, I led a project to spotlight young alumni ‚Äî bringing new energy and perspective to the series so current and prospective students could better see themselves in Alma‚Äôs story. We produced eight new videos in total.</p>
    <p>My role included coordinating interviews on campus, editing video and audio in Adobe Premiere, designing supporting graphics in Photoshop, and writing companion Q&A features for the Alma College website. I collaborated with team members who assisted with filming and audio capture.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>5 Facebook posts ‚Äî average reach of 2,398 users per post</li>
      <li>8 YouTube videos ‚Äî 712 total views</li>
      <li>5 LinkedIn posts ‚Äî average of 1,987 impressions per post</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Tartan</h3>
    <p>Alma College‚Äôs alumni magazine, connecting Scots near and far</p>
    <p><strong>The Tartan</strong> is Alma College‚Äôs alumni magazine, published twice each year to coincide with major fundraising and engagement events ‚Äî Alma Day and Homecoming. Since 2020, I‚Äôve served as editor, overseeing 10 issues that blend storytelling, design, and donor engagement.</p>
    <p>Each issue is a true team effort. I work with campus leadership to shape story direction, coordinate photoshoots, interview and write features, and collaborate with a designer to bring each piece to life. I also produce web-exclusive videos, manage online publishing through WordPress, create e-newsletters in Constant Contact, and promote content on social media.</p>
    <p><strong>The Tartan</strong> reaches more than 13,000 print subscribers per issue and includes a donation envelope that consistently drives results ‚Äî generating over $141,000 in contributions since 2020, including a 42% increase from 2023 to 2024 and another 35% rise from 2024 to 2025.</p>

    <h3>Alumni Newsletter</h3>
    <p>Engaging alumni through storytelling and design innovation</p>
    <p>From 2023 to 2025, I served as project lead for the <strong>Alumni Newsletter</strong>, an email-only publication designed to complement <em>The Tartan</em> print magazine. In this role, I collaborated with staff, students, and alumni to shape editorial direction, conduct interviews, develop calls-to-action, and create compelling designs.</p>
    <p>The newsletter was originally produced solely in Constant Contact, but I led an initiative to integrate Adobe Express into our production process ‚Äî enhancing visual appeal and workflow efficiency. Six newsletters were produced in total.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sent to an average of 8,603 subscribers per newsletter</li>
      <li>Average open rate of 54.7%</li>
      <li>Average clickthrough rate of 9.7%</li>
    </ul>
